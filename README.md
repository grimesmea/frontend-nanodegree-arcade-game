The Story
---------
You are the young princess Celia. You want nothing more than to ditch your
needle point lessons and whatever else a princess is expected to do all day
to become the kingdom's best fletcher.

Despite the protests of your parents, you have secretly started an
apprenticeship with the royal fletcher. While you are able to easily sneak out of
royal keep at night to attend, getting back without being discovered is another
story because the portcullis is locked and the castle grounds become infested
with Tweedle Beetles at sunrise every morning, just when you are on your way
back to the keep.

You must retrieve the key to open the portcullis and get back into the keep
while avoiding the beetles in order to not get caught since you can only contain
your disgust but so much when stepping on them.

Complete the remainder of your apprenticeship to win!

How to play
-----------
Use your keyboard's arrow keys to move and the "Enter" key when prompted to
start the game, begin the next level.

You have three lives, represented by the hearts shown above the player's head.
You will lose one life every time you collide with a bug. Colliding with a bug
will also move you back to your starting position.

Objective
---------
Get the key and as many gems as you can and make it to the top of
the screen (i.e., through the portcullis). The portcullis will remain closed
and impassable until after you have you retrieved the key.
